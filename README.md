# Data Collections in Python
- Lists and Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets

### What is a list?
- Lists are commonly used to store data
- They are mutable
- Syntax `[]` used to create a list
- List items are also indexed
- Different data types can be mixed in the same list
  
### List methods
- List values can be changed with eg. `ex_list[0] = "first"` to change the first value to "first"
- `ex_list.append("new")` adds the value "new" to the end of the list
- `ex_list.pop(0)` removes the value at the given index, or the last value if no index is specified
- `ex_list.remove("item")` removes the value "item" from the list
- We can also use slices with lists
