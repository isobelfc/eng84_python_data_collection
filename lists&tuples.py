# What is a list?
# Lists are commonly used to store data
# Lists are MUTABLE
# Syntax [] used to create a list

shopping_list = ["bread", "chocolate", "avocados", "milk"]
# print(shopping_list)
# print(type(shopping_list))
# print(shopping_list[1])
# print(shopping_list[-2])

# Change the value of 0 index from bread to oranges
# shopping_list[0] = "oranges"
# print(shopping_list)

# Add a value to the list
# shopping_list.append("ice cream")
# print(shopping_list)

# Remove a value from the list
# shopping_list.pop(0)
# print(shopping_list)
#
# # We can mix data types in a list
# mixed_list = [1, 2, 3, "one", "two", "three"]
# print(mixed_list)
#
# # Slices with lists
# print(mixed_list[2:3])

# Tuples
# Syntax ()
# Tuples are exactly the same as lists but they are immutable
essential = ("paracetamol", "toothpaste")
print(essential)
print(type(essential))
# essential[0] = "cereal"  # will return an error
# print(essential)

# Moving on to dictionaries
